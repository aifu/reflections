Q.When would you want to make a remote repository than keeping all your work local?

when collaborating with someone else, or show the commit changes to the public

Q.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You can choose the exact commits/branches to show to the public.
Changes can be made directly on GitHub, but better to pull. 

Q.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks is cloning a repository between github accounts, clones is making a copy of a repository into a diff rep, branches can only be made inside a single rep
